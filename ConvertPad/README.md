# ConvertPad ðŸš€
A simple mobile application to convert between two different currencies only.
Available currencies are USD and LBP.

Note that, exchange rate is not following the black market rate, even though i couldve used my [LBP RATE API](https://github.com/Murf-y/LBP-DollarRate-API) to get the black market rate, however i had to stick with the assignement requirements.
